# Robotics at Columbia University

SHAPE Robotics is an intensive three-week course that introduces the theoretical and lab
components of robotics to the students. In this course, students work to design and fabricate a
toy robot capable of extinguishing a candle within a predetermined maze. Aside from electronics
that are provided in kits, students design and fabricate components of the robot. Design is
finalized in modern solid modeling software, SOLIDWORKS. Assembly of the robot,
programming and testing follows. By designing and fabricating original ideas for their robot,
students learn principles of solid modeling, sensor technology and locomotion.
